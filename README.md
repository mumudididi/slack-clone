## Introduction

This is a practice project forked from [Ben Award](https://github.com/benawad/slack-clone-server/tree/master). The objective of the project is to get familiar with GraphQL, full-stack app development process as well as deployment process.

### side note

The Original Project was built in 2017. Since then Slack has been changing so as all the technologies used. In my fork, the following has been incorporated:

- Apollo server migration from 1.0 -> 3.0. Adapted with _sequalize_ library and React.
- Adapt code for react Hooks.
